-- About

NitrousTracker is a fork of NitroTracker, a FastTracker II
style tracker for the Nintendo DS originally created by
0xtob. If you didn't understand that, you might want to
read up on trackers. For starters, NitrousTracker is a
versatile tool for creating music - everywhere! It supports
the popular XM file format that is used by many PC trackers
and that can be played on many PC audio players such as
Winamp or XMMS.

-- Installation

Copy NitrousTracker and some music and samples to
any folder of your memory card and start tracking!

      questions
    * starpause for providing the samples used in the
      tutorial
    * Michael Krause for the open source SoundTracker,
