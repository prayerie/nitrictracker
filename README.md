## About

NitrousTracker is a fork of NitroTracker, a FastTracker II
style tracker for the Nintendo DS originally created by
0xtob. If you didn't understand that, you might want to
read up on trackers. For starters, NitrousTracker is a
versatile tool for creating music - everywhere! It supports
the popular XM file format that is used by many PC trackers
and that can be played on many PC audio players such as
Winamp or XMMS.

You can learn more about NitrousTracker on
[the official documentation website](https://docs.asie.pl/nitroustracker).
